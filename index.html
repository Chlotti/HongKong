        <h2>A day in Central</h2>
            <p>Hong Kong is one of the most vibrant cities around the world. With almost 8 million people living there, it is about as big as New York City. I have heard a lot of people comparing with NYC. To me the city is a mixture of NYC, London, Naples and of course, chinese culture. There are so my different things to do and explore. Today, I want to talk about how to spend a day around the Central area of Hong Hong. Central is one of the most vibrant areas, located on Hong Kong Island. You can easily reach the area by Metro or buses.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3><em>My five favorite spots around Central:</em></h3>

            <td>The Peak Tram takes you up to The Peak, which is a viewpoint overlooking the harbor, all the way over to Kowloon. I would recommend taking the tram up the hill and walk around a little. There is a loop you can take to see different viewpoint around the peak. If you are hungry you can get some food in one of the many places up there. For a spectecular view, you grap a bite at <a href="https://www.peaklookout.com.hk/" target="_blank">The Peak Lookout</a>, which is supposed to be one of the restaurants with the best views!</td>

        <h4>Hong Kong Park</h4>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
            <td>Hong Kong Park is a fun little place close to the Peak Tram. They have a sweet little pond, which creates a relaxed atmosphere. It is the perfect park for a sunday stroll or if you need a peaceful break from the big and sometimes pretty loud city.</td>

            <td>With the Hong Kong Observation Wheel you have an exciting activity and get to go high to see the view as well. Tickets are not that expensive, which is why this is an affortable way to see the skyline, compared to The Peak. And it might be the more fun activity, if you are traveling with children, because you spend more time on the Wheel itself, than on the Tram.</td>

        <h4>The tram around Hong Kong Island</h4>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
            <td>The tram is part of the public mass transportation here in Hong Kong. The tram is only available on Hong Kong Island and has multiple connections, which go from the east to west and the other way arround. They connect Kennedy Town with the reacecourse in Happy Valley, but also drive to Shau Kei Wan on the far east of Hong Kong Island. It is a fun way to explore the island and you will always have a little breeze, because the windows are always open. Driving the tram feels a little like a traveling back in time, which is really fun and refreshing!</td>

            <td>Tamar Park is located infront of Victoria Harbor. You have the perfect view to the other side, where the Kowloon Public Pier is located. We went to the park on the National holiday on October 1st, which was the <strong> perfect </strong> location to view the big firework! We had a great time and I think the park, as well as the promenade, are perfect places to just enjoy the view, maybe have a picnic and just have a good time with friends and family.</td>

        <h3><em>Great food spots in Central</em></h3>
        <p>There are so many different places to eat at in Hong Kong. You can get local food almost everywhere, a must try are probably Dim Sum and the egg tarts. I feel like that are the most popular things to try here. For more inspiration about good and cheap food options, you can watch this YouTube video:</p>
